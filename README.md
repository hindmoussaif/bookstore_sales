# bookstore_sales
This repository focuses on a marketing study that examines consumer behavior in an online bookstore. Using Python, we perform univariate and bivariate analysis on these consumers to effectively target our offers and provide the best customer experience.

By conducting in-depth analyses, we aim to gain insights into consumer preferences, purchasing patterns, and factors influencing their buying decisions. Through univariate analysis, we explore individual variables such as demographics, browsing habits, and purchase history. Bivariate analysis allows us to identify relationships and correlations between different variables, enabling us to understand the interactions and dependencies within consumer behavior.

The Python scripts provided in this repository utilize statistical techniques and data visualization libraries to derive meaningful insights from the consumer data. Our goal is to leverage these findings to tailor our marketing strategies, personalize recommendations, and enhance the overall customer experience on our online bookstore platform.
